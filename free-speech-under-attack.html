			<p>It is not entirely unfair to say that in some places of the world, free speech is under attack.</p>
			<p>In this century, the British government has passed multiple laws criminalizing certain kinds of speech critical of Muslims and homosexuals.  These groups face unfair discrimination and hate speech, which these laws are trying to correct.  However, criminalizing the speech is a problem because it is in violation of people’s basic rights to voice their opinion, no matter how unpopular or hateful.  Instead of making such speech a criminal offense, societies should allow for healthy discourse where such an idea is debunked and the other side is allowed to have their say as well.<a href="#sources">[1]</a></p>
			<p>The United States executive branch is currently trying to take a bite out of freedom of speech in the United States as well.  The FCC, under chairman Ajit Pai, have ruled to repeal regulations that required internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver all lawful content on the Internet to users who request it, and deliver all that content equally.  Aside from the anti-free market problems that arise from the repeal, such as the potential for preferential “fast lanes” that prioritize certain content over others and can easily squash small businesses, so-called “Internet Freedom” has startling implications for the future of free speech.  ISPs now have the ability to block any content they wish. This means that they can deprive small businesses reliant on the Internet to even exist.  “Alt-tech” sites such as Minds.com, Gab.ai, and Vid.me (although Vid.me already shut down due to being unable to compete with YouTube) would have a very hard time paying ISPs to have comparable speeds to big companies, on top of all the other costs of running a business and the challenges of competing with tech giants.  These “alt-tech” sites were intended to be havens for free speech in the face of sites like Twitter and Facebook (more on that later). Additionally, ISPs have the ability to block websites that contain content that they do not approve of.  This is a dangerous position for a company to have.  The right to free speech on the Internet can now easily be violated by ISPs who choose to block certain unfavorable political opinions, or sites that speak out against ISP tyranny.  As if Internet companies didn’t already have a strong enough stranglehold on free speech…<a href="#sources">[2][3]</a></p>
			<p>ISPs aren’t the only companies with a startling amount of control over free speech on the Internet.  Social media companies are able to restrict what kind of content is on them.  This is directly at odds with freedom of speech.  YouTube is now infamous for demonetizing videos that are not “advertiser friendly.”  According to YouTube, an “advertiser-friendly” video cannot contain “controversial issues and sensitive events,” “hateful content,” “inappropriate language,” or content that is “Incendiary and demeaning,” among others.  Content that does not fit the advertiser friendly guidelines does not have advertisements placed on it, and therefore cannot earn ad revenue.  Additionally, videos that run afoul of YouTube’s community guidelines prohibiting “hateful content” can be demonetized or placed in “restricted mode.”  YouTube even takes action against “offensive” videos that do not violate their other policies by putting them in a “limited state.”  Such a move is clear censorship.<a href="#sources">[4][5][6][7]</a></p>
			<p>YouTube is not the only company with anti-free speech policies.  In Twitter’s hateful content policy, they state: “You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.”  Twitter does state that they try to review context before punishing someone per this policy.  They state that such actions can be punished by removing a person’s ability to tweet until they remove the offending tweet, or suspending (banning) an account.  Although they are taking action to combat hate speech, which may seem like a noble goal, they are violating users’ right to free speech by censoring them.<a href="#sources">[8]</a></p>
			<p>As the old saying goes, “I abhor what you say, but defend your right to say it.”  All speech, no matter how offensive, inflammatory, or just plain incorrect, should be permitted to exist.  Recently, European governments have been ignoring that right and passing hate speech legislation.  Additionally, massive corporations like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, have the power to restrict that right on their sites.</p>
