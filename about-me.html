			<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello, employers!  My name is Harry Dorer and I am a sophomore at Medfield High School.  At the time of writing, I've only lived in Medfield for about four months.  Before I moved here, I lived in Simsbury, CT, and went to Simsbury High School.</p>
			<p>Over my first few months in Medfield, I was able to make a number of new friends.  These people were attracted to my outgoing personality.  I believe that this is a trait that would serve me well in retail situations.  I can be friendly to customers as I have been friendly to my peers in Medfield, and I can hope to accomplish a high rate of customer satisfaction.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I have been a performer for almost ten years.  This means that I am used to being in front of a crowd.  I am used to overcoming shyness while on stage and I can appear pleasant and likeable.  I can be comfortable in front of a large group of people.</p>
