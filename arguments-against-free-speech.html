			<h1>Why Shouldn't We Have Free Speech?</h1>

		<div class="article">
			<p>Freedom of speech may seem obviously good, but there are some legitimate arguments to be made against complete freedom of speech.  Hate speech can be a harmful form of speech to the person whom it targets.</p>
			<p>Those who say that hate speech should not be protected argue that the hate speech causes members of traditionally marginalized groups to suffer.  If we heavily regulate advertising, punish libel and slander, and prohibit endangerment of safety, why can we not prohibit hate speech?<a href="#sources">[1]</a></p>
			<p>However, those who say that free speech should be protected argue that the hate speech does not do significant harm to people.  The classic example of speech that is not prohibited is yelling “Fire!” in a movie theater where there is no fire.  Doing so can incite a panic, and cause people to be harmed.</a></p>
			<p>The Supreme Court has ruled in multiple cases that in cases of hate crimes, speech cannot be punished but acts can.  A good example of this is Wisconsin v. Mitchell.  In this case, after a movie which depicted black people being beaten, a group of black boys spotted a white boy walking.  One of them shouted, “There’s a white boy, go get him!” and the group proceeded to physically attack the boy.  The Court ruled that the attackers could be punished for their actions, but not for the speech.<a href="#sources">[2]</a></p>
